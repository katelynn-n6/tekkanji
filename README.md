# tekkanji テッカンジ（テック＋かんじ）

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is supported by the [KanjiAlive API](https://app.kanjialive.com/api/docs).

This project supports the kanji characters introduced by the Japanese department at Georgia Tech, with support for both the [GT textbook](https://a2096-19034049.cluster208.canvas-user-content.com/courses/2096~1190/files/2096~19034049/course%20files/kanji/kanjilist-new.html) and the Genki textbooks (3rd edition).

## Learn

After selecting your class, textbook, and lesson, the learn page displays a flashcard for each character containing:
* english meaning
* the stroke order of the kanji
* onyomi and kunyomi readings
* examples (JPN, click to see ENG) + audio
